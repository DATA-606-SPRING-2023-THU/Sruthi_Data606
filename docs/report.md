# Project Title :Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Project Overview
- Credit Card Fraud Detection is the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions made using credit cards. It involves the use of various techniques such as statistical analysis, data mining and machine learning to detect unusual patterns and behaviors that indicate potential fraud.
- The importance of Fraud Detection for Credit Card companies cannot be overstated, as fraud can result in significant financial losses for both the card issuer and the cardholder. 
- It can also damage the reputation of the credit card company, resulting in a loss of customer trust and loyalty. 
- Therefore, it is essential for credit card companies to have effective fraud detection systems in place to protect their customers and themselves. 
- Determine which classifier works best for classifying the data
- Also, Try to implement Artificial Neural Network and compare the accuracy to the best classification model.

# Questions intended to answer
To prevent from fraudulant transactions from taking place in the future, we can use ML algorithms to:
- Understand the distribution of the data that was provided to us.
- Create a sub-dataframe of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions.
- Determine which classifier works the best for classifying the data.
- Also, try to create a Neural Network and compare the accuracy to the best classifier achieved.

# Technologies Used
- programming language : Python.
- libraries : Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn, scipy, Tensorflow.
- algorithms : classification, regression models along with Artificial Neural Networks.

# Repository Structure
- docs : directory for project draft and final documentations.
- src : directory for project code base.
